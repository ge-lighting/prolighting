## Add Pictures to the App
To Update pictures you have 2 locations under settings for the Home image and each of the room images.  Its important to update these to help the end user differentiate the rooms differently.  We recommend taking pictures of each room even if the rooms are not complete and the customer can allways update the images at any time.
