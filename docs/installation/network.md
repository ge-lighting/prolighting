# Network

## Terminations
This is how you terminate cat6 cableing with RJ45 Connections

## Router
The router WAN port is connected to the customers cable modem lan port as shown in this image.

If you are using an access point as a router you can use either port.

If you are using the erro pro then you will use this port for the connection to the router

## Network Switch
A network switch is used to provide additional switch ports.  You will need a port for each device like:

* Savant Host
* Wireless Access Point (one for each if there are multiple)
* Connection to the router
* Bond Bridge (Shade Hub)

## Wireless Access Points
Each wireless access point needs to be wired directly back to a central location. If you are using a erro Pro you will need to make sure the switch port you are plugging into has POE (Power Over Ethernet)

## Savant Equipment
Each piece of savant hardware will need a 1 network cable connected to the network.  If one is not availible you can wirelessly connect some components to the network
