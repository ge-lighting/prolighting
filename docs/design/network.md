### Router
A router is required for each install and is the "Brain" to the network.  This will be the device that is connected to the customers ISP (Internet Service Providers) modem.  This will create a local network inside the house that will stay the same even if the customer changes internet service providers or even upgrades their hardware.  This is a critical piece to providing a stable and reliable system install.

Recommended Routers could be:

### Wireless Access Points
Wireless Access points are needed to ensure the home has adequete covereage of WiFi signal to each room and sometimes outside.  Each access point will share the same network information as the other and multiple access points may be needed based on the size of the house.  It is recommeded to have cat6 cabling run to each of the wireless access points to provide the best service but in somce scenarios  that may not be possible and you may need to use a wireless repeater.

## Basic WiFi Planning
When planning for wireless access points arround a home it is recommended to choose central locations on each floor not placing access points directly ontop of eachother.  Range of access points will vary based on construction material where sheetroock and wood construction will have better range, Metal studs and sheetrock will have less range and concrete block construction will have very low range.  Please see an example of the wireless coverage of the same house with different construction to see how the construction material effect the signal.
