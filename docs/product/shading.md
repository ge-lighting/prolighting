# Savant Shades

## Shading Products
Savant has designed a bespoke shade that can be installed in minutes.  When designing a shade you have several design considerations for each shade.

* [Where will the shade be installed](#where-to-install)
* [How much light do you want to come through the shade](#choosing-fabric)


## Where to install
when installing a shade you have several options as seen in this image below.

* Above the window trim
* On the window trim
* Inside the window trim
* On the Ceiling
* In a Ceiling Pocket

Other things to consider is the direction the fabric will roll off the shade as in this image.

* Forward roll toward the window
* Reverse roll away from the window

Options like this should be considered when there are door handles or windw hardware that may get in the way.  Also when you want to minimize the amount of gap between the window and the shade.

## Chosing Fabric
When choosing a fabric there are many factors to choose from.  To start you will want to decide how much light you want to go through the shade.

* No Light - Blackout
* Some Light - Translucent
* More Light - Sheer

While a blakcout shade is straitforward ad does not let any light through the difference between translucent and sheer is a little more subtle.  Translucent lets light through but does not alow you to see objects on the other side of the shade either in or out of the window.  Sheer fabric lets you see shapes and outlines through them and range in open ness from 1% which provides the most amount of light and only a little bit of privacy up to 15% which provides less light and more provacy.

## Measureing

When designing a shade you will need to measure the height and width of the window.  It is recommneded to measure each direction 3 times.  for example when measuring the width you will measure the width at the top of the shade, Middle of the shade, and bottom of the shade and if your installing the shade inside the window you will use the smallest number.  If you are mounting ontop of the window you will use the largets number.
