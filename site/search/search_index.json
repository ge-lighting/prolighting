The right panel of the window shows the components, resources, and wiring connections that are used to implement the services that are selected in the left panel.</li></ol> <p>Note: The Realized Services list provides a list of available AV services based on the components and wiring specified. The set of enabled, realized services determines the set of menu screens that will be available on the touch panels.</p> <p>Note: The Unrealized Services list provides a list of possible services that might be realized from the set of components but the existing component wiring or configuration does not allow these services to be realized. This list also provides a way to help you to troubleshoot when you are not seeing Realized Sservices that should be available. This situation can occur due to wiring and configuration errors.</p> <ol><li>From the Realized Services list you can choose the services you want to implement.</li></ol> <ul><li>If a particular service has more than one implementation, those implementations will be shown as subheadings of a service.</li><li>If a service has multiple implementations, each implementation will have a radio button next to it.
