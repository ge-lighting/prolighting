You must place at least two components in the Layout area.</p> <p>Note: Include a\u00a0Generic Signal Source\u00a0component in each zone with other radio/cable/satellite components that require antenna or signal connections.</p> <p>Note: Use the\u00a0Generic StereoSpeakers\u00a0and\u00a0Generic SurroundSpeakers\u00a0components to represent any passive stereo speaker or surround sound speaker systems.</p> <p>Note: Include an Apple iPad component (any UI) in the configuration.</p> <ul><li>You can select a placed component by clicking on the component icon.</li><li>By moving components to positions outside of the white background, the Layout view extends by the number of pages required to enclose that component.</li><li>The\u00a0Layout\u00a0view expands only to the right and down. If you try to place or drag a component near the top or left of the Layout view, it will be placed as close as possible to the right and down while still keeping the component visible.</li><li>A small green dot on each component allows you to show (maximize) or hide (minimize) unconnected connectors, so you don't have such a large component when you place it. The\u00a0View &gt; Minimize all Components\u00a0and\u00a0Maximize all Components\u00a0menu items from the RacePoint Blueprint menu allow you to minimize or maximize all the components.</li><li>Delete a component by highlighting it and using the &lt;command&gt; &lt;delete&gt; keys.</li><li>You can select multiple components to move or delete by clicking and dragging in the Layout view. All components and/or wires are selected that intersect the rectangle that is drawn as you drag into the Layout view. You can also select all components and wires with the\u00a0Edit &gt; Select All\u00a0menu item and then drag the group to make room to the left at the top of the Layout view.</li><li>If a component has been placed on the Layout view, but is not visible, use the\u00a0Edit &gt; Select All\u00a0menu item from the RacePoint Blueprint menu (or by using the &lt;command&gt; &lt;a&gt; keys) to select all the components. Drag the component group down until the component appears.</li><li>Once a component has been placed in the\u00a0Zone/Component\u00a0list, change the name of the component by clicking it to select and then click it again to open it for editing.</li><li>Once a component has been placed in the\u00a0Zone/Component\u00a0list, change the component with one from the same device class. Drag the component from the\u00a0Show Library\u00a0and drop it onto the component in the\u00a0Zone/Component\u00a0list. A screen will display asking whether you want to change components. The name of the replaced component will be retained by the new component but all connections will be lost if it has been wired.</li></ul> <p>Wiring the Components</p> <p>The\u00a0Select Styles\u00a0panel in the\u00a0Preferences window of the RacePoint Blueprint menu allows the user to select the colors used for highlighting connectors while wiring and to select the color, width, and line style of the various kinds of wires.</p> <p>Refer to Preferences: RacePoint Blueprint Programming Guide for detailed information.</p> <p>The media connectors, in the\u00a0Layout\u00a0window, are sorted as either an\u00a0input\u00a0or\u00a0output\u00a0on each component and sorted into the following groups:\u00a0</p> <ul><li>Video, Audio, and Signal connector types\u00a0</li><li>Data and Control connector types</li><li>Logical I/O (Video and Audio) connector types</li></ul> <ol><li>Click a connector inside one of the components. All of the compatible connectors on other components will highlight (the text will become bold and change color to what you have set in the\u00a0Select Styles\u00a0panel in the\u00a0Preferences window).</li><li>Drag the connector you originally selected and drop it on the associated connector on the other component.</li></ol> <p>A wire will be drawn (in a color and width as specified in the\u00a0Select Styles\u00a0panel) and the connector highlight will change to indicate that the connector has now been wired.</p> <p>Note: Make sure to draw radio, satellite, and cable signal connections from the\u00a0Generic SignalSource\u00a0component. Also, draw the control (RS-232, IR) connections from the Savant Controller in addition to any audio/video connections among components.</p> <ol><li>After the components are wired, you are now ready to Generate Services for the configuration.</li></ol> <ul><li>You can also make connections by holding the &lt;control&gt; key down and clicking\u00a0 a connector or right-clicking a connector if you have a multi-button mouse. A popup menu will appear with all of the legal connections listed, grouped by component. Simply select the desired connection in this menu and the connection will be made.</li><li>The wires are run point-to-point. The wire can run underneath another component, if necessary. It only makes a connection at an end-point as shown by the connection dot.</li><li>The\u00a0Layer Filter\u00a0button group\u00a0A V S D C\u00a0(Audio/Video/Signal/Data/Control) allows the user to highlight the buttons representing the various types of wire connections.</li><li>If a button is highlighted, that wire type connection will be shown.</li><li>If a button is not highlighted, that wire type connection will be hidden.</li></ul> <p>Note: The\u00a0View\u00a0menu from the RacePoint Blueprint menu also provides menu items to access a list of Zones that can be selected or deselected to show or hide the components and wires within any zone or zones.</p> <ul><li>You can erase a wire by clicking the connector at either end or somewhere along the wire itself and using the Edit &gt; Delete\u00a0menu item from the RacePoint Blueprint menu (or by using the &lt;command&gt; &lt;delete&gt; keys).</li><li>You can wire to a minimized component only by using the contextual (control-click) menu. To wire by using drag and drop, you need to first maximize both components (if one or both are minimized).</li><li>If you want to modify certain connection property values or require detailed component information, click Inspector\u00a0to open the\u00a0Inspector\u00a0window and refer to\u00a0Error!

Refer to Service Selection: RacePoint Blueprint Programming Guide for detailed information.</li><li>From this window you can see the realized services list (and if you choose the View &gt; Unrealized menu item, you will see the unrealized services list). The right panel of the window shows the components, resources, and wiring connections that are used to implement the services that are selected in the left panel.</li></ol> <p>Note: The Realized Services list provides a list of available AV services based on the components and wiring specified. The set of enabled, realized services determines the set of menu screens that will be available on the touch panels.</p> <p>Note: The Unrealized Services list provides a list of possible services that might be realized from the set of components but the existing component wiring or configuration does not allow these services to be realized. This list also provides a way to help you to troubleshoot when you are not seeing Realized Sservices that should be available. This situation can occur due to wiring and configuration errors.</p> <ol><li>From the Realized Services list you can choose the services you want to implement.</li></ol> <ul><li>If a particular service has more than one implementation, those implementations will be shown as subheadings of a service.</li><li>If a service has multiple implementations, each implementation will have a radio button next to it. Only one can be enabled at a time.</li><li>If a service has only one implementation, it will have a checkbox next to it. A service (and any subheadings) will be disabled if the box is not checked.</li><li>You can enable or disable a service or an entire zone of services.</li><li>You can disable some of the subheadings of a service but not all of them.
